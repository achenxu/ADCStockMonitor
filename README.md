Adidas Stock Monitor By @hunter_bdm

Install: 

0. Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

1. Open CMD in repo directory

2. Type `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Run:

1. Double click run.py or open cmd in repo folder and type `run.py`

2. Enter SKU and how often to check stock.

Extra:

When stock goes live it should make a sound, it may not work on OSX

The "starting stock" is the first stock the script gets, so not necessarily the REAL starting stock.
